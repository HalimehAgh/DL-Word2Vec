# DL-Word2Vec: Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Word2Vec model for generating word embeddings. The process includes training the model, saving it, and showcasing the results through a hosted Streamlit application. The dataset includs 25,000 film reviews and the objective is to train the word embeddings matrices on this data.
